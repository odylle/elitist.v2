# Elitist: Todo list

The idea has now changed into making it just a tool for supporting a session.
I dont need historic data, just current, whilst on a trip.

##### Ideas:

Navigation Route support. Check system against EDSM data
Interesting bodies. Exploration: High value, WW, ELW, etc. ExoBio: Signals and Genuses
