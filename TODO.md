# Elitist: Todo list

The idea has now changed into making it just a tool for supporting a session.
I dont need historic data, just current, whilst on a trip.



### Feature

These are initially a braindump of thoughts. If there are too many I'll make a backlog of sorts

- [ ] Feature: Exobiology values estimate functionality
- [ ] Feature: Actually make use of the footer
- [ ] Feature: App updates check on github. Fix token expiration issue
- [ ] Feature: Jumps remaining, distance to navRoute destination?
- [ ] Feature: Indicator that all bodies have been discovered

---
### Improvement
- [ ] Improvement: Font-size hard to read on iPad screen. Check actual size?
- [ ] Improvement: Undiscovered / unmapped icon. Different Color? Icon?
- [ ] Improvement: Box sizes. Maybe be more responsive to screen?
- [ ] Improvement: Not sure I like the color of the biosignals as displayed on a body either.

### Issues

- [ ] Issue: Sometimes when a session in restarted it didn't track the actual progress of ScanOrganic.
