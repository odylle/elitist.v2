<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### The Idea
I've used (and still use) lots of companions and initially this is just my pet project. I wanted a simple informational companion to help me explore and do exobiology. The first iteration fo Elitist was larger and supposed to have way more features. But with features comes complexity and I'm limited by time. I quit Elite for quite some time, I keep coming back to it once every so often and enjoy the massiveness of it. 
i want this application to just be informational whilst exploring. Does the system I've now arrived in have bodies I should scan? How many signals are there and is the body worth landing on to analyse it's signals? Is it already explored? 

Nothing more initially, to keep the scope manageable and enjoying data in a way that I like consuming it.
There are vague plans to do more with materials for when I need more engineering done and need to farm them, same goes for cargo and potentially just having a view of what I'm carrying, or have mined for example.

v0.6.2 is the first version I've actually test driven and everything seemed to work as expected, which gives me confidence in expanding the functionality and improving the readability. (I'm using a iPad as a 2nd screen, given I own a 49" monitor and have no second screen. The text is slightly small apparently ;))
